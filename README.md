# Bachelor of Cybersecurity - Coursework Portfolio


Welcome to my university coursework portfolio! This repository is a curated collection of the major projects, lab reports, and technical assignments I have completed as part of my **Bachelor of Cybersecurity** degree at the **University of Technology Sydney (UTS)**.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the practical application of the concepts I've learned, from designing secure databases and hardening systems to implementing cryptographic protocols and deploying cloud infrastructure.
