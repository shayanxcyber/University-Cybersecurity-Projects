# 41900: Cryptography and Applications

This folder documents the work completed for the Cryptography and Applications course, a cornerstone of my Bachelor of Cybersecurity degree. The curriculum provided a deep, practical understanding of the mathematical principles and real-world applications of modern cryptography.

The course culminated in two major hands-on implementation projects, demonstrating the ability to build secure systems from the ground up using industry-standard tools and protocols.

## Core Competencies Developed

*   **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** End-to-end management of a private Certificate Authority, including certificate generation, signing, and deployment.
*   **Blockchain & Distributed Systems:** Practical deployment and interaction with a private Ethereum PoW network.
*   **Secure Protocols:** In-depth, hands-on experience with SSH, SSL/TLS, and HTTPS.
*   **Cryptographic Tooling:** Proficiency with essential command-line tools like **OpenSSL** and **geth (Go Ethereum)**.
*   **Applied Cryptography:** Translating theoretical concepts (hashing, digital signatures, asymmetric encryption) into functional code and secure systems.

## Major Implementation Projects

The following two projects were completed for this course. Each is hosted in its own dedicated repository to fully showcase the scope of the work.

### 1. Secure HTTPS Server (PKI) Project

This project involved building a complete Public Key Infrastructure to secure a web server with TLS. I acted as my own Root CA to issue and sign a valid X.509 certificate for a web server, demonstrating a full understanding of the chain of trust that secures the modern internet.

### 2. Private Ethereum Blockchain Project

This project involved deploying a private Proof-of-Work Ethereum blockchain from scratch. This included creating a custom genesis block, managing accounts and wallets, initiating a miner, and executing transactions on the private network.
