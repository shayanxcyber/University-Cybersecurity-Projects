# Personal Portfolio Website (Web Systems Project)

This repository contains a personal portfolio website built from scratch as the major project for the **31268 Web Systems** course at the University of Technology Sydney.

The project's goal was not only to demonstrate fundamental web development skills but also to apply core system administration and security principles by deploying the site on a Linux server and configuring appropriate permissions from the command line.

### Key Features & Technical Skills Demonstrated

*   **Manual Web Development (HTML5 & CSS3):**
    *   The website was built entirely by hand without the use of frameworks, demonstrating a strong understanding of core web technologies.
    *   Structured with **Semantic HTML5** elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`) for better accessibility and SEO.
    *   Styled using an external stylesheet (`websystems.css`) with **CSS3** features like Flexbox for layout, media queries for responsiveness, and keyframe animations for subtle visual effects.

*   **Responsive Design:**
    *   The layout is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop monitors. This was achieved using CSS media queries to adapt the layout and font sizes based on screen width.

*   **UNIX Server-Side Deployment & Permissions:**
    *   A critical component of this project was the server-side setup on a Linux environment.
    *   This involved using the **UNIX command line** to create a secure and logical directory structure for the website files (`mkdir`).
    *   File and directory permissions were meticulously set using the **`chmod`** command to ensure the web server could read the necessary files while protecting them from unauthorised access or modificationâ€”a fundamental security practice.

*   **Project Reflection & Accessibility:**
    *   The `comments.html` page in this repository contains a detailed self-reflection on the project's technical implementation, design choices, and accessibility considerations, such as the consistent use of `alt` text for all images.
