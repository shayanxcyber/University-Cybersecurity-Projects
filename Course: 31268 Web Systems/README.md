# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website created as the final project for the **31268 Web Systems** course at the University of Technology Sydney. The project was built from scratch using fundamental web technologies to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of web development, server-side setup, and security principles.

The website serves as an introduction to me, detailing my background, my academic journey, and my future aspirations in the field of cybersecurity.

### Key Features & Technical Skills Demonstrated:

*   **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and functional on various devices, from mobile phones to desktops. This was achieved using CSS Media Queries to adapt layouts, font sizes, and navigation elements.
*   **Semantic HTML5:** The structure is built with semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>`, ensuring the site is accessible and easily parsed by search engines and screen readers.
*   **CSS3 Styling:** The site is styled using an external CSS stylesheet, employing features such as:
    *   Flexbox for layout management.
    *   CSS Animations (`@keyframes`) for subtle fade-in effects.
    *   Pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `.active`) for interactive navigation.
    *   `box-shadow` and `border-radius` for modern UI elements.
*   **Accessibility:** Core accessibility principles were implemented, including the use of `alt` text for all images to support visually impaired users.
*   **UNIX Server-Side Management:** A key requirement of this project was not just building the site, but deploying it on a Linux server. This involved:
    *   Using the command line to create a secure and logical directory structure (`mkdir`).
    *   Setting appropriate file and directory permissions (`chmod`) to ensure the web server could read the files while protecting them from unauthorised access or modification.

### Areas for Improvement

As reflected on the comments page of the site itself, future improvements could include implementing ARIA attributes for enhanced accessibility and further refining keyboard navigation.
