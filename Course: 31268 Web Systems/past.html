                    My HSC experience was decent, I suppose. I took a bit of an odd combination of subjects: English Standard, Business Studies, Economics, Physics, and Maths Standard – I know, Physics and Maths Standard together seems like a strange choice! To be honest, my favorite subject was English, but mainly because of the fun classes with my friends and teacher, not so much the actual content. Physics was definitely my least favorite; it was really tough and I didn't enjoy it at all. Overall though, I did pretty well in all my subjects, except physics lol.

                    I've actually had quite a few different jobs, each with its own unique experience. My first job was at McDonald's when I was 15. It was a good experience overall, mainly because I got along really well with my coworkers who were all around my age. I learned a lot of valuable things there, but the work itself wasn't the most enjoyable – the hot working environment and lack of customer interaction weren't really my thing.

                    Working at David Jones was a nice change of pace. It was still customer service, but in a completely different setting. I worked in the homewares department and got to interact with a lot of interesting people every day. One day, I helped a couple choose the perfect dinnerware for their new home, and another time I assisted a renowned interior designer in selecting unique pieces for a client's project. The only downside was that I didn't have any coworkers close to my age, so we didn't have much in common. However, I did have some really valuable conversations with them and learned a lot from their life experiences.

                    My favorite job by far was refereeing football games. Being so passionate about the sport and having the knowledge to back it up, it was incredibly rewarding to be right in the middle of the action. It's a very different kind of customer service compared to retail. Instead of serving customers directly, I was managing the game, ensuring fair play, and making crucial decisions that impacted the outcome. It was challenging at times, but the thrill of being involved in the sport I love made it all worth it.

                        <p>As you might have guessed, I'm pretty involved in the world of football. Playing the sport has always been a huge part of my life, and I've spent countless hours on the pitch, both in organised leagues and casual games with friends. </p>
                        <p>Beyond football, I used to volunteer at food drives, which was a really humbling and rewarding experience. It felt good to contribute to the community and help those in need.
                        </p>
                        <p>For a while, I even played Fortnite competitively and managed to earn a few thousand dollars from tournaments. It was a thrilling experience to test my skills against other talented players and see how far I could go. While Fortnite was my main competitive game, I also enjoyed playing other games casually and competitively with friends.
                        </p>
                        <p>Staying active is important to me, so hitting the gym was a regular part of my routine. I also participated in my high school's debating team, which helped me develop my critical thinking and public speaking skills. It was definitely outside my comfort zone, but it turned out to be a valuable and enjoyable experience.</p>
