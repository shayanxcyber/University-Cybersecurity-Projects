            <p> I'm a huge football fan, support the best team in the world Barcelona, Visca Barca. My favourite player is Messi who of course is the greatest of all time. I enjoy listening to a variety of music. Some of my current favorites are Ken Carson, Deftones, Wisp, Tv Girl, and Brent Faiyaz . I used to be really into gaming, professionally, competitively and casually, playing everything from FIFA and Fortnite to Valorant and Minecraft, but I haven't had as much time since finishing high school.</p>
